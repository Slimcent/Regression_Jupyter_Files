    "7 interesting facts about decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    ".They do not need the numerical input data to be scaled. Whatever the numerical values are, decision trees don't care.\n",
    "\n",
    ".Decision trees handle categorical features in the raw text format (Scikit-Learn doesn't support this, TensorFlow's trees implementation does).\n",
    "\n",
    ".Different to other complex learning algorithms, the results of decision trees can be interpreted. It's fair to say that decision trees are not blackbox type models.\n",
    "\n",
    ".While most models will suffer from missing values, decision trees are okay with them.\n",
    ".Trees can handle imbalanced datasets. You will only have to adjust the weights of the classes.\n",
    ".Trees can provide the feature importances or how much each feature contributed to the model training results.\n",
    ".Trees are the basic building blocks of ensemble methods such as random forests and gradient boosting machines."
